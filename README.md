## 📄 Description

`SYNCHRONIZE.ps1` is a powershell script that enables users to quickly and efficiently mirror their personal directories onto a USB drive.  
It performs a one-way synchronization from the local PC to the USB drive, meaning:

- 🟢 New and updated files on the PC are copied to the USB drive.  
- 🔴 Files deleted from the PC are also removed from the USB drive.  

> **Note:** This process is intended for **data mirroring**, not for backup purposes.  
> It ensures that the USB directories remain identical to the user’s Windows personal folders.

## ⚙️ Operation overview

### 1. Unique user directory
- Generates a unique user directory.
- It combines the user name, computer name and a short SHA-1 hash of the user’s SID to ensure the directory name is unique.

### 2. Storage space validation
- Before synchronization, the script checks the available storage space on the USB drive.  
- Synchronization proceeds only if there is enough free space to accommodate all new or modified data.  
- If space is insufficient, the script stops and notifies the user.

### 3. Synchronization process
- Mirrors the contents of the user’s Documents, Pictures, Videos and Music directories to corresponding directories on the USB drive.  
- Additions, modifications and deletions are replicated to maintain an exact mirror of the local Windows directories.

## 🧩 Important notes

- The initial synchronization performs a **full data transfer** and may take some time.  
- Subsequent synchronizations are faster because only **changed or updated files** are processed.  
- The script is designed for **mirroring**, not backups.
